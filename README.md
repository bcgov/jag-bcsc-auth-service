# jag-bcsc-auth-service
BCSC Auth service (eCRC microservice) by Ministry of Justice

BCSC Auth service API utilizes the OIDC library to integrate with the BC Services Card (BCSC) to verify user identity. 

The BCSC Auth service API provides two endpoints which:

1. allows the user to redirect to BCSC and authenticate
2. allows an API client to retrieve personal information of an authenticated user

Please refer to `Prerequisites` section for BCSC configuration requirements.

Technical Overview
---------------------
| Layer   | Technology |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Service | Java, SpringFramework |
| Application Server | Spring Boot / Tomcat |
| Runtime | Pathfinder OpenShift |

## Installation:
### Local Environment:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#### Prerequisites

Prior to using this API, the following needs to be requested from the BCSC:

| Variable        |                        Description |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------: |
| BCSC_CLIENT_ID  |  Unique client ID for your service |
| BCSC_SECRET     |                      Client secret |
| BCSC_SCOPE      |                       Client scope |
| BCSC_RETURN     |                  Client return URL |
| BCSC_PER_SECRET | Client PER claim decryption secret |


Possibly STS4 (Used to create this initial code base).

Note: Clone the repo then import as a 'Maven' project into STS4.

#### Environmental variables for running the service locally

The following Windows environmental variables must be set either as Windows environmental variables or as STS4 Spring Boot App variables.

| Variable                         |   Example Value |
| -------------------------------- | --------------: |
| BCSC_OAUTH_BASIC_PASSWORD        |        password |
| BCSC_OAUTH_BASIC_USERNAME        |            user |
| BCSC_OAUTH_IDP                   |         IDP url |
| BCSC_OAUTH_JWT_AUTH_ROLE         |      Authorized |
| BCSC_OAUTH_JWT_HEADER            |  Authorization2 |
| BCSC_OAUTH_JWT_PREFIX            |          Bearer |
| BCSC_OAUTH_JWT_SECRET            |   Authorization |
| BCSC_OAUTH_SERVER_PORT           | SOMETHINGSECRET |
| BCSC_OAUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY          |            3000 |
| BCSC_OAUTH_WELL_KNOWN            |         someUrl |
| BCSC_PER_SECRET_<BCSC_CLIENT_ID> |      someSecret |
| BCSC_RETURN_<BCSC_CLIENT_ID>     |         someUrl |
| BCSC_SCOPE_<BCSC_CLIENT_ID>      |     oAuth scope |
| BCSC_SECRET_<BCSC_CLIENT_ID>     |   client secret |

#### Installing

```
mvn clean install
```

#### Run locally (Tomcat server)

```
mvn springboot:run
```

#### Set project version using maven

```
mvn versions:set -DartifactId=*  -DgroupId=*
```

Note: If using STS4, see the **Boot Dashboard** window instead of using the Maven command above.

#### Application Context Path

```
http://localhost:8083/oauth
```

#### Endpoints

| Endpoint                                                                   | Parameters                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| http://localhost:8083/oauth/initiateBCSCAuthentication?returnUrl=returnUrl | returnUrl - The url to redirect after authenticating with BCSC                |
| http://localhost:8083/oauth/getToken?code=code&returnUrl=returnUrl         | code - The authentication code provided by BCSC after user login              |
|                                                                            | returnUrl - The url to redirect after user information is retrieved from BCSC |

#### Autodeploy

This application will autodeploy after every save. (Due to Spring Boot Devtools in the POM).

#### Docker

## Access Control - IP Whitelisting
To allow client application to access this BCSC auth service, the IP address of the client application must be added to the route configuration. Use white space to separate multiple IP addresses. Here is an example:
```
...
annotations:
	haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist: 142.34.208.209 142.29.196.27
...
```
